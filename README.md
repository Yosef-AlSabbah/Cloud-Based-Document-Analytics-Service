## üìñ Project Requirements & Approach

This project was developed as a cloud-based program for basic data analytics, document search, sorting, and classification. Below is a summary of the requirements and how they are addressed in this platform:

### Requirements Addressed

| Requirement                                                                 | How It Is Addressed                                                                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Collect a large number of PDF/Word documents                                | Upload via drag-and-drop, file picker, or web scraping from URLs.                                                     |
| Store documents in the cloud                                                | Uses Supabase for secure, scalable cloud storage and database.                                                        |
| Update collection anytime                                                   | Upload new documents or scrape new sources at any time via the interface.                                             |
| Sort documents by title (extracted from document, not filename)             | Title extraction from document content; sorting and filtering in the UI.                                              |
| Search documents for text/keywords                                          | Full-text and fuzzy search with instant results; highlights found keywords in document previews.                      |
| Highlight search text in output documents                                   | Search results show highlighted keywords in context.                                                                  |
| Classify documents by a predefined tree using any algorithm                 | Hierarchical classification tree (Academic, Technical, Business, Legal, etc.) with AI, rule-based, or hybrid methods.|
| Provide statistics (size, number, search/sort/classify time, etc.)          | Analytics dashboard shows document count, size, upload trends, and operation timings.                                 |
| Use any programming language and cloud platform                             | Built with React/TypeScript (frontend), Supabase (cloud backend), Vercel (deployment).                                |
| Well-documented, readable, and maintainable source code                     | Modular, commented codebase; clear folder structure; usage and contribution guides in README.                         |
| GitHub repository and cloud program link                                    | [GitHub Source Code](https://github.com/Yosef-AlSabbah/Cloud-Based-Document-Analytics-Service) and [Live Demo](https://cloud-docu-analyzer-nexus.vercel.app) |
| Write a report describing algorithms, platform, and usage                   | See below for a summary of algorithms and platform choices.                                                          |

## üß† Algorithms & Platform Choices

- **Title Extraction:**
  - Extracts the actual document title from PDF/Word content using custom parsing utilities.
- **Sorting:**
  - Sorts documents by extracted title, not just filename, for more meaningful organization.
- **Search:**
  - Supports keyword, phrase, and fuzzy search. Highlights found terms in document previews.
- **Classification:**
  - Uses a hybrid approach: combines AI/ML (e.g., text embeddings, TF-IDF) with rule-based logic for robust, explainable classification.
  - Classification tree includes Academic, Technical, Business, Legal, and their subcategories.
- **Analytics:**
  - Tracks and displays statistics: document count, total size, upload/search/classification times, and trends over time.
- **Cloud Platform:**
  - Supabase for authentication, storage, and database; Vercel for deployment and CDN; React/TypeScript for frontend.
